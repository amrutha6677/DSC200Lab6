# DSC200Lab6
Instructions:
Part 1:
In part two of lab 5, you were required to choose 3 datasets for the exercises. In this part you 
are required to download your chosen datasets from that lab, write a Python function that 
merges the datasets into the single file which will be used for analysis later. Your python file
should include a link to the files. Alternatively, you may include the downloaded file in your 
submission. I will be downloading each file and be testing your code using those files.

Part 2:
The files linked in the Canvas assignment from which this document is accessed have several
data cleaning issues. Among the many issues the dataset has are repeated observations and 
features, and for some other categorical features, the inconsistent data. One of the files 
contains descriptive information about the data in the second file, while the other contains the 
actual data. More details about this file can be found at 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Adult
Write a Python function that cleans this data set. Make sure to check all the data cleaning 
issues we discussed in class and ensure that your script accepts the path to the file and creates 
a new file containing the cleaned-up data. This new file should be stored in the same directory 
as your script. Give the new file a meaningful name. The script should print the number of 
features and observations prior to and an after the cleaning task to the console.

What to submit:
Submit a single python script containing the two functions described in parts 1 and 2 above. If 
you choose to include the downloaded files from for part 1, submit a zipped file containing the 
python script and the data files. Implement a simple menu that asks the user to select one of 
the two functions. When selected, your scripts should perform the requested function.
